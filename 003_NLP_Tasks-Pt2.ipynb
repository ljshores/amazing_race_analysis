pulled hillary out of school and took her on trips when they travel hillary s pet peeve is when deidre combs her hair and gets it all over the bathroom floor but she is so much fun to be around hillary adds we laugh like crazy people when we are together deidre and hillary decided to team up for the amazing race because in hillary s words who wouldn t want two sensational girls to make the

grade at hutchinson high school in hutchinson minnesota cyndi was a new transfer student that year and the two have been together ever since during their year marriage they have traveled together many times because they live in a cold place they like to head south to the ocean for a couple of weeks in winter thus their best travel experiences usually involve lying on a beach according to cyndi our worst travel experience is when i have tried to get by cheap and we end up in a dive and have to scramble for a hotel at the last minute russell and cyndi decided to team up for the amazing race to face the challenge of racing around the world seeing all the beautiful locations but most importantly building a lifetime memory with each other as they approach the starting line they resolve that win or lose we will allow this experience to draw us closer together our relationship with god and each other can not be measured in any dollar amount what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what is your favorite film what is your favorite tv show who is your favorite actor who is your favorite actress what is your favorite band what comfort item from home will you miss the most\n",

backwards in public this team tends to attract attention whenever we are together people stare at us and ask us what are we doing because we are causing so much chaos when we tell them we are sisters they are in shock what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what is your favorite film what is your favorite tv show who is your favorite actor who is your favorite actress what is your favorite band what comfort item from home will you miss the most notes by the time mary peach got to the roadblock they were too far

chris and alex met on the school bus heading for their first day of kindergarten and have been friends ever since they ve traveled extensively together logging about a million miles on road trips according to alex the best thing about traveling with chris is that he is just as crazy as i am chris counters with his own assessment the best aspects of traveling with alex are his extensive travel experience and his uncanny ability to get us into some very interesting situations the only weakness he has is that he s a loose cannon but you get used to that what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what is your favorite film what is your favorite tv show who is your favorite actor who is your favorite actress what is your favorite band what comfort item from home will you miss the most bio q a chris the strengths i bring to the table are my level headedness and the ability to think through situations and determine all the options and the best course of action the inherent weakness of being like this is that my decisions aren t spur of the moment or impulsive like they sometimes have to be alex i have an extensive amount of travel experience i also speak a few languages i have probably done more than most at the age of it would be tough to put me in a situation that would intimidate me my weakness is most likely my impulsiveness i don t always think before i act chris alex has a good head on his shoulders and quick decision making skills the only drawback to this is that even though he s smart he sometimes doesn t think things through and runs around with his head cut off for a while alex chris is one of the smartest people i know he has two engineering degrees and a minor in spanish he can mastermind a game plan like no other chris is also one of the strongest competitors i know chris s weakness is probably his confidence making quick decisions he sometimes ponders over a problem when he already knows the answer chris goonies and shawshank redemption alex scarface chris seinfeld alex wild on e chris robert de niro alex al pacino chris tea leoni alex catherine zeta jones chris

       "19    gina and sylvia are two something stay at home moms from hilton head island south carolina who are constantly on the go whether it s changing diapers helping with homework or cheering on a little one at a soccer game the pair have been busily taking care of their families and haven t had much time to focus on themselves while both moms attended the university of south carolina they met and became friends at a baby shower instead of pursuing careers outside of their home they both decided to become at home moms and they ve been close ever since as gina and sylvia experience the joys and frustrations of motherhood their children whose ages range from months to years have already shared many memorable moments together the amazing race gives team soccer mom the chance to experience an adventure away from their families before they head back to the chaos of daily life our lives revolve around kids carpools diapers cleaning bathrooms laundry etc says gina i personally have had very little opportunity to travel everything i do on a daily basis is about my family i want to do this trip for me sylvia agrees i want to do something for me i love taking care of my children but it s a job that requires one to devote themselves totally to someone else she adds i m also doing it for my daughter i want her to see me do something special i don t want her to think that all i did was sit at home while they re on the road both gina and sylvia have photos of their families with them so they can keep them close to their hearts during the tough days that lie ahead with their easy going southern nature they think they have the charm and sensibility to come out on top plus to them the challenge is nothing compared to being a mom with a hectic family schedule how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a gina i personally have had very little travel experience the caribbean and a handful of states that s one of the reasons i m so excited about this trip sylvia i haven t done much traveling as an adult as a child i traveled with my mom to peru she is from peru but the older we got my siblings and i we didn t travel with her she went alone after i was married my husband and i went to england gina the most stressful aspect of traveling i think will be the language barriers it s going to be frustrating and scary at times being unsure of where you re going and unable to communicate that is a vulnerable position to be in sylvia on this race the most stressful aspect of traveling has to be our limited resources we can t just check into a hotel or whip out a credit card and get out of town or hop on a plane not to mention the language barrier gina i packed two pictures of my husband and children they are my inspiration i really want them to be proud of me sylvia i m carrying a photograph of my husband and our three children they are my inspiration they are the reasons for most everything i do gina i got married at right out of college my husband and two children are my life i love them more than anything and wouldn t change a thing but i want to do this race for me everything i do on a daily basis is about someone else i need to prove to myself i can do this sylvia my world is filled with my children and my husband and i m really happy with that this is something that i m doing for myself because i want to i wanted to show my children that they too can do anything they want in life that their world doesn t have to have limitations gina all of our previous travel experiences consist of you guessed it vacations with the kids we load up the minivan and take our five children anywhere family oriented and driveable it is very chaotic at times but we re hopefully making great memories for the kids sylvia we ve taken short trips we ve never traveled outside the country i have a minivan that will fit the two of us and our children so our trips have always been short and fun and within driving distance gina my fear would be to be presented with a challenge i may not be successful at therefore letting down my team what i really hope to discover about myself is not my fears but that i am stronger mentally and physically than i ever gave myself credit for sylvia i think i fear letting my partner down and myself i want to push myself emotionally and physically i believe i can do it i don t want to disappoint myself or gina so i guess i m fearful of my own limitations and finding out what scares me or what pushes my buttons gina physically i am not as strong as sylvia i also think i tend to get impatient my strengths lie in the thinking clearly and studying the angles in the decision making process sylvia i think i can be strong physically i tend to be more of the risk taker i communicate well i think my weakness is that i can be more emotional i sometimes have a short fuse gina physically sylvia is definitely the stronger of the two of us she also can talk the two of us in and out of anywhere we need to go she is funny and charming people love her her weakness would have to be not paying attention to the details we balance each other well we let each other lead where they are strongest sylvia gina brings rational thinking to our team she s a great problem solver she s smart she s strong she s a great leader we balance each other well i tend to be stronger physically that is mostly just because of her size gina what i will miss more than anything is not material it is people my husband and children everything else seems relatively unimportant it s only a month you can do anything for days sylvia i will miss my three children and my husband most of all i believe i will learn to appreciate my house my van my backyard etc i think we all take for granted the simple things that as americans we have living in our country is truly a privilege gina only english and a few spanish words sylvia english and about ten spanish words gina i would love to go to greece or italy sylvia i would love to go to peru specifically machu pichu my mother is from peru and i have family there i want to see this magical place that i have roots in i haven t been to peru since i was a small child i have just some vague memories gina i really don t feel more prepared for any one particular place obviously the english speaking countries will be easier to get around i m just going to take each destination as it comes and give it my best sylvia none i haven t traveled the world this is going to be a great adventure and one that i ll never forget\n",

andrew are different as night and day andrew is a liberal openly gay college cheerleader his father dennis is a conservative southern baptist who manages a family entertainment center dennis says he decided to apply for the amazing race so he could spend some quality time with his son i would love to travel with andrew outside the country before he moves on and starts his own life said dennis andrew says his primary motivation was to see the world the thrill of traveling to places unknown to me seems very intriguing said andrew my second motivation would be to give kentuckians someone to root for both dennis and andrew are concerned about keeping clean on the road andrew says the most important item in his backpack is his razor since he hates looking scruffy dennis is making sure to pack plenty of soap other than food sanitation is the key to health if you are not feeling well nothing else matters he says the father and son team feel their diversity will prove to be an asset in the race while dennis has experience and wisdom on his side andrew s strength agility and charisma may help lead the team toward the finish line how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a dennis above average i have traveled outside the u s on six different occasions andrew my travel experience has been limited to the u s i ve been to many parts of the country primarily for cheerleading competitions and family vacations but haven t gotten to venture outside of our borders yet dennis preparation trying to guess what could be necessary in every situation is a disturbing situation andrew i ve always worried about forgetting something really important like money food or deodorant yah know the necessities dennis soap it is important to stay healthy on a venture like this other than food sanitation is the key to health if you are not feeling well nothing else matters andrew a simple razor is important to me because i hate looking scruffy however i wouldn t get too far without a passport i m a clean cut guy so i have to have my beauty supplies dennis i love to travel and to go to these exotic places and do these activities to share with the world is unimaginable andrew the thrill of traveling to places unknown to me seems very intriguing but also the chance to be an advocate for the gay community is something i ve felt a calling to do and to be in the public eye i can hopefully be a good role model dennis only domestic family vacations it was enjoyable but in no way comparable with this adventure andrew my dad and i have traveled together within the states but i m an international virgin so i m prepared to travel with an open mind dennis my biggest fear is holding up to the physical demands most of the competitors are much younger and fitter andrew my biggest fear period is sharks so of course i m nervous i ll be asked to swim with them or something of that nature jaws is one of my favorite movies so yah see hollywood does warp your mind dennis our strength is diversity we are the only team with a large age division i bring experience and wisdom but my age and physical condition could be a weakness andrew my greatest strength is my personality i m very nice and tend to get along with everyone in all walks of life although i am very naive when it comes to international traveling plus i m the youngest on the race i just recently turned dennis andrew s strength is agility and charisma there should be no physical challenge he can t complete and he loves to interact with people he never meets a stranger andrew dad is very headstrong when it comes to traveling he s been there done that he does have problems with heights so i hope that s not a factor that slows us down dennis i ll miss my wife and daughter most of course but beyond this i truly miss cola drinks when i travel andrew what i ll miss the most is my friends and family i have an awesome group of friends in kentucky and my mom sister and brother are very cool plus of course i ll miss the guy i m dating dennis none fluently andrew very little spanish if that helps me in the race i ll definitely have to call my high school spanish teacher and thank her dennis jerusalem it is such a center for history i have always dreamed of seeing sights such as the temple mount wailing wall garden tomb etc andrew i ve always wanted to go to africa i love the cultures there and the landscapes i guess that s why my bedroom is very tribal with leopard print and african masks dennis germany because i have done some travel there andrew australia seems to be a lot like the u s as far as language and style so i d probably be best prepared for a country like ours since i haven t traveled internationally yet\n",

university of michigan for undergraduate and heather received a b s from cornell university a seasoned traveler eve spent a summer in madrid and six months in london while attending the london school of economics heather also spent a year abroad in oxford london they know that their smarts could ultimately guide them to victory but their secret weapon is to use their looks and charm to manipulate people into helping them along the way these friends and roommates look to this experience as an opportunity to finally put the books down and travel the world before starting their law careers eve hopes this will also help her overcome some of her biggest fears which are flying and extreme outdoor sports while heather hopes that her enthusiasm for adventure and challenge will rub off on her teammate how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team

but once i am there i realize it was all worth it heather good hiking shoes and socks eve good socks for dry feet heather to enjoy adventure travel while gaining insight into myself and perspective on my place in the world eve i believe that the race is my personal odyssey going to harvard i have spent three years in my head that is where i excel i am not a physically adventurous person and the challenges that i will hope to face will force me to confront some of my biggest fears heather nope eve no heather and i have traveled separately but traveling together will be a new exciting and scary experience for both of us heather getting hopelessly lost while driving through some south american jungle or african desert eve losing in the first round heather strengths adrenaline junkie i love the challenges and hopefully will pass some of that enthusiasm onto eve weaknesses poor sense of direction and don t love cities eve i am good at getting things so far i can work bureaucracies

                                                            michael and kathy met a year and a half ago in cancun mexico they have kept in touch and maintained a long distance dating relationship however they have never spent more than five days together at a time their primary motivation for going on the race is to see how compatible they are as a couple what struck kathy about michael were the provocative questions he asked her on their last night in cancun when they spent hours together talking and getting to know one another this was enough to prove to kathy that michael is a genuine person worthy of maintaining a long distance friendship kathy and michael are polar opposites kathy is more high strung under pressure and michael is very laid back michael describes himself as unconventional amusing and dark while kathy describes herself as moody caring and oversensitive they both agree that their different personalities complement each other well michael has done quite a bit of traveling throughout mexico england france holland spain and canada while kathy has been to mexico philippines and canada the most important item in his backpack is his cd player because he feels that music will change any mood into a good one her most valuable item is her journal how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a michael i m well traveled with experience dealing with numerous cultures kathy most of my travels have been within the united states outside of that the only countries i have visited are mexico canada and philippines michael the time between stepping off a plane or train and finding some place to spend the night kathy adjusting to different climates and time zones other than my normal seems to put me in a funk for a day or so michael my cd player and cds music gives me power and can turn any mood i m in into a good one kathy my empty journal seems value less right now but once i am able to write about my travels it will be the one item in my backpack that will be of worth to me that and my hairclip michael i m a sucker for a free vacation kathy the race has a lot of great elements that i find appealing competing traveling and working as a team with my teammate michael michael we ve been to different locations in the states and have always had a good time kathy we actually met while we were both on our travels michael and i live on different coasts so the only way to see each other was to travel we ve been to cancun and various states it s always like a great mini vacation michael losing to a couple of squares kathy initially it was to be the first team eliminated on the race deep down i truly don t feel that we will be however to get past the first leg of the race will take off a lot of anxiety for me michael i bring travel experience levity and unabashed confidence to the team i have no weaknesses kathy i am a people person for the most part which will help in communicating with different people however when under pressure i can tend to be a bit high strung and become moody michael she brings salesmanship and a cute face to the team men go out of their way to help her and we ll use that obtaining directions and other help when needed like myself she has no weaknesses kathy michael is very patient and always stays calm in any given situation which will help me calm down a very good sedative having said that sometimes i wish i could jolt him up a bit to get him more energized michael my cat tig aka li l baller kathy the actual comfort of home from home cooked meals to taking a shower just being michael english decent spanish kathy other than english none fluently michael egypt the pyramids kathy bali i want to confirm all the hype and any part of europe since i ve never been michael mexico seeing that i spent half a year traveling it kathy i can t say i m prepared best for any given country if i had to pick a region then i d say asia south asia being asian may be an asset in those countries so that could be advantage to me additionally my travel experience in philippines although many years ago has not been forgotten\n",

florida academy of dramatic arts aaron thought she was stuck up a show off and developed a huge crush on her that he want to crush her they are the worst of friends and have traveled through life together it s been like a steel coaster scary they have shared many wonderful memories together and hard times as well the only problem with being more than just friends is that aaron is gay and arianne is straight as arianne says her biggest disappointment with aaron is that they planned to be together some day they will not be naturally conceived they both look at this experience as an opportunity to travel the world with their best friend aaron describes himself as passionate loyal and carefree while arianne describes herself as emotional exotic and down to earth they feel that they will win because of their physical abilities agility urban sensibility and of course their sense of humor the agree that the most important items in their backpacks are their ipod and wristbands because as they say music inspires us and our style inspires others aaron and arianne are fluent in both body language and the international language of love how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a aaron i ve done a lot of domestic and a little international traveling it s all been a positive experience i love to see new things meet new people and especially eat new foods i m looking forward to seeing more arianne i ve had some good times in a small handful of countries it s high time to cover the rest of the world aaron the actual act of traveling airports have a tendency to stress me out so does waiting in lines large crowds and cramped spaces arianne obtaining airline tickets long lines and misplacing my passport aaron our ipod our wristbands music and style are integral parts of our lives both individually and as a team arianne we have an ipod wristbands and pretty persian scarves this is very important because music inspires us and our style inspires others aaron the chance to check out of my day to day life and have the adventure of a lifetime with my best friend also more and more the money seems to be appealing arianne i have nothing better to do than take a free trip around the world and win a million dollars aaron yes domestic and short term but always a blast arianne we have traveled through life together it s been like a roller coaster scary thrilling and so much fun aaron eating live insects and being in deep ocean waters arianne i m afraid of eating live bugs and the chance my parachute won t open aaron i m very focused when i set my mind on something it gets done i can usually get what i want and i can multi task with the best of them my directness in getting things accomplished can sometimes be off putting to others i get so focused that i have a tendency not to recognize how i affect others when task mastering i have no patience arianne my strengths tend to be aaron s weaknesses and vice versa i tend to be more laid back and tolerant of the status quo whereas aaron brings a certain clear minded focus these traits can be strengths or weaknesses depending on the situation we really complement each other in that way we re both in the best shape of our lives and have a fierce endurance we re agile and able to learn and adapt to awkward physical challenges our urban sensibility makes us well suited to handle new cultures and our sense of humor makes our weaknesses a little less weak and a lot more funny aaron arianne is compassionate capable determined and sexy her physical strength blended with her inner and outer beauty sprinkled with her urban savvy survival instincts and sense of humor is a recipe for success her only weakness in relation to the race might be her judgment with people she wants to believe in everyone arianne see my answer to the previous question aaron my cats siena and sydney first but coming in a close second is my shower and all its gorgeous products arianne i will miss my cat ming i ll also miss my phone aaron the international language of love arianne i speak body language fluently aaron i d love to do some extensive european traveling especially in the mediterranean arianne i have this tokyo itch i really want to check out japan aaron aside from language barriers i feel confident that i m prepared for anything or anyplace arianne i lived in the u k for a semester during college i know london pretty well and have visited scotland and wales and the locals seem to have a real grasp of the english language\n",

first the opportunity to compete in a forum that is challenging physically and mentally and second the cash cha ching damon says that his greatest asset on the trip is his brain the most important item i am carrying is not in my backpack it is underneath my hat i am pretty smart and resourceful he says andre feels his strength is his ability to read the other teams and understand the game together this pair of friends have traveled extensively while stationed in the military damon served in the marine corps and andre was in the united states air force both are self confident physically fit and work incredibly well under pressure plus whenever necessary damon can be a manipulative schemer while andre is a playful joker together the two are a formidable team who plan to give their fellow racers a run for the money how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a andre my previous travel experience basically limits to what i did while in the military i have done some stateside domestic traveling damon i have traveled to several places while in the military i e alaska honduras vancouver b c saudi arabia kuwait belgium however my leisurely travel has been limited to nigeria and the republic of benin i have also traveled within the u s andre packing and traveling with luggage damon the most stressful aspect of traveling is landing at the airport i read that most accidents have to do with aircraft landing andre passport and id because without it i am in trouble damon the most important item i am carrying is not in my backpack it is underneath my hat my brain i am pretty smart resourceful andre to do something totally out of my element damon i was looking for a challenge one that was physically and mentally tough the amazing race looked like a race that requires both of those items and more oh and don t forget that million would buy a lot of golf balls andre we traveled to new york together it was fun damon we traveled to new york from maryland while in college it was a three hour ride i don t really consider this trip to be travel andre not winning damon the fear of failing is the scariest thing about this whole experience i fully expect to win anything less would be hard to deal with andre good decision making skills strength too calculating weakness damon i bring self confidence and i m at my best under pressure i work in a pressure filled environment for me this is a natural condition not to many people can say this my job deals with life or death for myself and fellow firemen or the safety of citizens andre he can be a little more direct than me strength damon andre is very self confident as well however he is also analytical and calculating these characteristics create a balance to my spontaneous and risk taking traits andre my wife whom i ve missed since the day i left damon the item i miss the most is my cell phone however i miss my kids aisha and wesley tremendously andre english damon none andre somewhere in south america damon egypt there is so much history in that country i would love to see the pyramids andre u s damon the good ol usa\n",

          thirty two year old twins derek and drew can t recall the last time they got into a physical fight with each other except maybe that time in when they had it out in the back of their parents buick the pair is originally from chicago but currently live in los angeles after graduating from the university of illinois derek and drew pursued careers in modeling and acting and have appeared in commercials for revlon and hosted shows on vh and e while drew is currently a photographer derek hopes to pursue his dream of becoming the next michael j fox drew is still a bachelor but derek was married this past june as a result they haven t seen each other much lately and drew is hoping that this experience will give them the chance to reconnect i couldn t come up with a better excuse to spend this much quality time with my brother joked drew derek and drew believe that the most important element to getting ahead in the race is cleanliness drew is making sure he packs his toothpaste toothbrush and dental floss and says it s nearly impossible to communicate effectively with bad breath derek reveals that he won t leave home without his deodorant i just hope to maintain a reasonable level of cleanliness and odor while on the race otherwise it s almost impossible for people to deal with you he says they may not be the doublemint twins but derek and drew will definitely be looking and smelling their best during their latest adventure they re convinced that their strength endurance and level headedness will help them cross the finish line ahead of the pack how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a derek my travel experience has been fairly extensive i have lived in italy germany and england i have also lived in new york chicago miami and los angeles drew i have traveled extensively inside the u s i have lived and worked in new york los angeles miami chicago atlanta dallas and have driven everywhere in between however i haven t traveled internationally in seven years and have only been to europe derek the most stressful aspect of traveling would be hygiene i just hope to maintain a reasonable level of cleanliness and odor while on the race otherwise it is almost impossible for people to deal with you drew trying to smuggle on oversized carry on baggage derek the most important item in my backpack would have to be either deodorant or clean underwear for reasons stated in my previous answer drew it s a tossup between toothpaste toothbrush or dental floss it s nearly impossible to communicate effectively with bad breath derek i m at a bit of a crossroads in my life and this seems like an excellent way to discover new things about myself and what i am capable of i also just got married and this is probably the only time the rest of my life that i will get to spend this much time with my brother drew i love the show and i couldn t come up with a better excuse to spend this much quality time with my brother away from his wife after only two months of marriage we haven t had a chance like this since he met his wife derek yes a lot and it has always been fun and relatively stress free however we have never raced anywhere and we are both very competitive so i expect it will be very different on the show drew yes we ve traveled a lot together it has almost always been very easy and fun we haven t physically fought on a trip since the back seat of my parents buick in derek that somehow i am portrayed as someone other than the fun loving playful and intelligent male model that i am drew the thing i fear most about competing in the race is actually watching the race i hate the thought of watching myself on tv derek my strengths are my ability to manage stress both my own and my brother s and my competitive spirit my weaknesses are that i think i know everything and i don t trust anyone drew my strengths would have to be my physical endurance and intuitiveness my weaknesses are my ability to manage stress yoga is something i used to do and my inability to ask for help derek my brother s strengths are his intelligence and his competitiveness he does not lose my brother s weaknesses are his ability to manage stress and beautiful girls drew derek s strength is his level headedness he can be positive in any situation and is always the voice of reason derek my wife we have only been married a couple of months so it was very hard to leave her to go on the race drew nascar derek english un poquito espa ol drew english and spanish un poquito derek africa kenya or tanzania drew africa mostly kenya and tanzania i would love to see the serengetti derek england or germany drew italy only because i lived there one summer seven years ago\n",

assistant have been good friends ever since they met five years ago in a cafeteria at vassar college while wearing a funny hat and a camouflage suit zach instantly caught flo s eye although flo and zach have shared a mutual attraction for each other over the years they ve never pursued a romantic relationship one of their most memorable times together was when they were both bartending in college says flo we would go crazy making drinks for the whole bar trying to be tom cruise in cocktail it was so fun to be silly with someone while working ironically one of the worst experiences they ve ever had took place while they were working together when a young girl became extremely ill from drinking too much flo and zach had to rush her to the hospital we had to deal with the ems and it was a really scary situation says zach who adds it was reassuring to go through it with flo although flo and zach are seasoned travelers the couple has only shared one hour trip together this team is convinced however that they have what it takes to come out on top according to zach i am the logistics man i m good with directions roughing it and keeping a cool head flo is very good at keeping things fun she s also great at getting people to do things they might not otherwise do flo and zach are looking forward to seeing some great places during the race and hope the experience will bring them even closer together how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a flo pretty extensive zach i have traveled extensively in europe east and west and have been to many other countries in south america i ve never been to asia flo missing flights and getting stuck in traffic zach after a while i find it stressful to be on the move but in general i find travel to be very relaxing flo my sunscreen and my tylenol migraines and a sunburn would surely slow me down zach probably my two pairs of super high tech underwear they dry in seconds and make you run faster very funny stuff flo to see great places and to win some money zach i wanted to be on the amazing race to have the adventure of a lifetime and win a million bucks in the process flo we ve never traveled together before except one hour drive to boston zach not really one time we took a marathon one day trip from new york to boston it was rugged but good training i hope flo no fears zach my biggest fear of competing in the amazing race is probably getting lost in a jungle or desert either that or losing in the first leg of the race but that won t happen flo i am a great traveler i get along well with others i am also very competitive the only weakness is that i love to go to sleep early and often fall asleep in random places i ve also never really roughed it zach i am the logistics man i am good with directions orienteering roughing it and keeping a cool head one of my weaknesses is that i am not as competitive as flo flo zach is brilliant he is really prepared and has great endurance also he is not afraid to wear one pair of underwear the whole trip his weakness not competitive enough zach flo is very good at keeping things fun she is also great at getting people to do things they might not otherwise do but she can t really drive stick and doesn t have much experience roughing it flo my family zach i ll miss my friends at home the wolfpack and my family flo italian french spanish zach spanish english czech flo china zach rangoon and ulan bator mongolia flo italy and any spanish speaking country zach chile and bolivia\n",

physically i tend to let people make decisions for me and this is a big step towards being independent and being able to do things for myself and for my team chris to win it making friends seeing great places being on tv that s all overrated i want a million dollars and the right to say i kicked your ass to other people amanda chris and i have taken some vacations here in the us and we have had so much fun traveling we seem to really get along well in stressful times which comes in handy when we re on the road far from home chris we have traveled but only to lame places like wisconsin texas and so on while we usually hate each other in our daily lives we get along very well when traveling it s really quite odd i guess going to another place lets us pretend we re someone else for a while amanda i fear being out of my comfort zone i like my days to be planned out however boring that may be i have a set time to do everything on the race i won t know when i ll eat next when i ll sleep next when i ll be able to go to the bathroom next i m also afraid to let my partner down chris finding out that the next place we ll be going is a country that s just a tad bit shady ya know like north korea or pakistan or yemen or canada those canadians they just always seem to look at you funny something just isn t right with them i think they re up to something amanda i am a very positive up beat person i love meeting people and i am very social and i like to help others i ll be able to talk to locals negotiate with other teams and get help when needed my weaknesses play off that i have a hard time competing because i care a lot for other people and i don t want to make them feel bad chris i don t have too many strengths i m more of a liability kind of guy but if i had to pick i d say my strength is my competitiveness i supply the drive to keep us going there are far too many weaknesses to list my primary fault is i m an asshole amanda he is very logical and rational and a wonderful decision maker he is very methodical in everything that he does and he weighs all the pros and cons before acting upon anything instead of acting quickly in stressful times he still enforces reason his one big weakness is that he is super critical about everything especially himself he is his own worst enemy and he has to evaluate everything he does or says sometimes he makes too negative of judgments and gives himself too hard of a time when it s not necessary chris her strength is her sweetness but don t let the candy coating fool you underneath it is a somewhat of an evil little woman and that also is a part of her strength she can act all innocent and sweet and then the next minute she is cussing like a truck driver and flipping people off in traffic her weakness is her ability to quit almost anything at a moment s notice she gives up way too easily and that is a big thing on this race amanda i am afraid of the dark so in our house we have various nightlights positioned throughout so needless to say i will miss my nightlights i know that i am going to be exhausted while traveling hopefully that will defeat my night time worries chris my worn out old green rocking chair it s great to just chill out in and think about stuff and that is something that i ll be forced to live without for a while relaxation amanda i speak english i learned some french in college and at that time i could read and write it fairly well and sometimes even engage in conversation i could probably ask some decent questions but i do not think i would understand people s responses i m pretty good at reading body language chris i speak english fairly well un poquito espanol a little spanish lsoay omesay igpay atlay also some pig latin amanda i love animals so really anywhere with a lot of wildlife around me is cool other than that i can not wait to see anything and everything this race has to offer bring it on chris the pyramids in egypt amanda um well the united states does everyone say that wish me luck please chris the one where phil will be standing waiting to hand us the million dollar check\n",

                                                    russell is a year old model actor entrepreneur who describes himself as hilarious and a leader he loves the adventure of traveling and greatly dislikes losing or failing at anything he admits he talks a lot but that he has an ability to get everyone involved people say he looks like mel gibson but he says he s like the tv character mcgyver because he gets things done he calls cindy a female film character james bond he is always on the go and can not stand not to be doing anythingl he claims to be very intuitive which can be a great gift or a pain in the butt about his going on the race with cindy russell declares some people may know their partners better but that may be what makes us so great to watch the unknown or x factor how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a russell quite vast have lived in taiwan japan germany italy for months at a time have also traveled to at least other countries for work cindy spontaneous in the past i was a model with ilene ford then moved over to wilhelmina agency that business was always a world of opportunity to travel to the major markets on a whim in between when i d vacation i d pick the most adventurous remote locations like indonesia russell the other people you come in contact with cindy personally i enjoy the unknown so sometimes i d get lost on purpose in a country just for the adventure of testing something new russell my socks if your feet don t get taken care of then they won t take care of you cindy the alarm clock russell for the adventure i have seen a lot of places but there is a lot more out there to see cindy this particular adventure would make a great home video russell no but it should be interesting cindy no but russell is the only man i d want to do this type of trip with russell there is not any fear just a lot of anticipation cindy bungee cord jumping sounds like a death wish to me russell my ability to problem solve and be a good leader i also laugh all the time which makes tough situations easier cindy when or if there is any type of emergency i m usually the one people rely on i am strong and clear i guess to some it s a weakness being free with a show of emotions but to me well i consider that an expression of strength russell she is strong willed and a great competitor as far as weaknesses we will have to wait and see cindy russell tends to compete and analyze a situation rather quickly and intelligently and then he handles it i find it quite comforting russell my friends cindy on a shallow note my caf lattes charming restaurants and candlelight russell english and some spanish cindy enough indonesian to get by a small handful of japanese to show an attempt to be polite russell egypt and africa cindy nepal egypt new zealand and back to indonesia russell no one in particular i m ready for them all cindy indonesia\n",

seven year old steve is a supervisor at a juvenile detention facility in santa barbara his biggest accomplishment is his year marriage to karen he is a big fan of the amazing race and when karen challenged him to go on the show with josh it all became clear father and son needed this trip together plus according to steve josh is really smart and in great physical shape steve went to los angeles to talk with josh about it and found him camped out on hollywood boulevard he had been there for days waiting for the newest star wars movie to premiere according to steve josh was ecstatic when he asked him to be his teammate on the race since then steve has been training by walking miles with a backpack every day he likens himself to andy griffith on mayberry rfd he loves to eat and wishes he had more willpower not to he and josh share a love of comic books and josh turned him on to building superhero models he prides himself on being a good negotiator and on being able to bullshit through anything how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a steve i have traveled to tijuana and across the us but nowhere else josh i traveled a little in high school but never did anything really extensive steve lack of sleep josh traveling is only stressful if you let it be so steve loads of socks and underwear and my favorite flannel shirt josh clean socks got ta watch your feet steve it is the adventure of a lifetime an opportunity to reconnect with my son and the cash josh it s the chance of a lifetime how many other people get to run around the world with someone they love steve most of our travel together has consisted of family trips when josh was smaller where he spent the majority of his time asking are we there yet or spilling juice in the back seat josh yeah it consisted of him driving the family station wagon cross country and yelling at my brother and i to stop fighting steve letting my partner down josh being eliminated first steve i deal well with difficult people and feel common sense is a trait i possess my weakness is that i can be too direct with others josh i m willing to do anything but sometimes i fail to think things through and end up having to fix a mistake steve josh is very intelligent and outgoing but he has a fearsome temper josh my dad s a rock he s steady and he s stable but at other times he s controlling steve other than the rest of my family probably a regular cup of coffee and my job which i love josh music and tofutti cuties steve only english josh english dad speaks american steve egypt would be awesome and china would be a real

               millie works as an environmental teacher at the tennessee aquarium and describes herself as a motivated fun daredevil adventurer with no fears except for mayonnaise she hates the stuff she holds a ba in communication arts from bryan college in dayton tennessee and has lived in taiwan teaching english and traveled to israel and russia speaks french conversational chinese and some russian millie was once on the tonight show after leno bumped into her and her roommate and asked them to say stupid baywatch lines in our shower in bikinis which we did so she has a wild side somewhere deep down she enjoys volleyball water skiing rollerblading snorkeling and swimming and blows off steam by running talking or fighting with chuck praying and reading the bible millie believes her man chuck is hotter than brad pitt on the downside her man can also be too anal and meticulous millie admits that she s bad with money too often speaks before she thinks and that they re both afraid to commit how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling what is the most important item in your backpack and why why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio q a millie i ve done a good bit of international travel to russia israel taiwan and china i ve always lived to travel and explore chuck i ve taken several road trips visiting states though i ve done some international traveling most has been in the us millie being out of your comfort zone traveling reduces you to the basis of who you are and reveals much about yourself you never knew that s also one of the best parts chuck time restraints when trying to see as much as you can also tight quarters can be awfully challenging when not traveling alone then again this inevitable togetherness is one of the greatest qualities of traveling with others millie pages i ripped out of the bible verse prayer book since i am a christian i try to read and meditate on verses everyday it helps me focus on what s important and prioritize i ll definitely need that on the race plus doing this makes me a more tolerable person to be around chuck the lightest item a light pack is key to faster time millie a trip around the world while attempting incredible challenges a chance to see what our team and relationship is made of chuck to compete travel around the world with my best friend and the millie mainly for vacations which we have always enjoyed but nothing as stressful and arduous as this we both have an adventurous streak so we ve always enjoyed going off the beaten path chuck we ve taken several road trips together and have always thoroughly enjoyed each other of course we have had our share of quarrels while traveling millie losing not just the but also losing the chance to make it all the way around the world compromising who we are and what we believe to win being rude or unkind when i m under stress chuck being eliminated and not being able to travel the world millie experience from the past will hopefully help us also i think i m a quick thinker and a fast mover i tend to look for creative solutions and can be resourceful i m not a quitter and am intensely competitive i can also be too hasty and make errors in judgment chuck my strengths are probably my competitive nature road trip experience athleticism and fearlessness regarding adrenalin rush activities my weaknesses are being too deliberate and analytical resulting in lost time and sometimes being too laid back millie chuck is very talented physically he is able to complete any physical challenge with ease also he has traveled a lot on the road which will hopefully help us in navigation he is not a quitter and is the most competitive person i know chuck can take too much time to make decisions chuck strengths relatively fearless very communicative and smart with people international travel experience fast thinker and never quit attitude weaknesses so fast sometimes she really doesn t think and is occasionally over trusting millie my family parents brothers sister and seven adorable nieces and nephews chuck definitely my mom dad sister all of my family and friends i m so blessed millie a little french a little mandarin chinese a little russian it s been a while since i ve spoken any of these chuck english and pointing this way or that way millie africa for the wildlife and diverse terrain chuck as many countries as possible and the last pit stop millie other than the us taiwan since i lived there a short while i feel i would be able to get around more easily than anyone else chuck other than my own any that has a lot of english speaking people\n",

                                                  dennis erika met while they were in college at new york university she was the resident assistant in charge of his floor and it was completely against the rules for her to date the dorm residents they found their way around this by booking a trip to italy together even though they barely knew each other their relationship progressed and they eventually got engaged but dennis broke off the engagement after erika went skydiving naked as dennis describes it i thought i was dreaming but no here comes my future wife floating through the air with nothing on but socks and sneakers and a naked instructor strapped to her back dennis erika s relationship has been through a lot six months after they started dating dennis saved erika s life by pulling her free from a vicious dog attack after that erika knew that she was in love when and where did you meet erika we met at the residence life lottery at nyu in early i was a resident assistant and dennis friends were trying to convince him to live on my floor he was refusing to live near the ra but his roommates finally convinced him after that we began our very inappropriate resident assistant resident romance if you could describe your relationship in one phrase or sentence what would it be opposites attract have you ever traveled together before if so what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together we have traveled together to italy greece and the french polynesian islands the best part of traveling together is that we are both very adventurous and willing to try things that most of our other travel partners would never even attempt new places allow us the opportunity to do activities and try new things that we wouldn t be able to try at home the worst part of traveling together is our indecisiveness we can never decide what to do next why did you decide to team up for the amazing race we teamed up for the race to test our relationship and see if we could handle the pressure of high stress intense situations as you begin the race how do you think this experience will affect your relationship we re very uncertain of how the race will affect our relationship we feel certain it will either make us stronger or break us apart but we re not sure if the race will force us to be a team for life or convince us to go separate ways what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team bio before the race dennis i m physically strong and well trained in running and biking my weakness is that i can be too nice erika i m very good at getting in people s heads and figuring out what they are thinking i can also be manipulative and have a win at all costs mentality my weakness is that i am overly dramatic and cry easily dennis erika is very witty and is always able to think outside the box to come up with an idea that nobody else has thought about her weakness is that she is a complete and total drama queen who always has to get her way erika dennis strength and weakness is one and the same he is the most kind genuine and honest person in the world which makes him a bit na ve his honest nature makes him trust people too easily which is a detriment in this game\n",

dating on and off for three years the two of them met as students at an athletic convention at the university of pittsburgh and then ran into each other at a bar a few weeks later as alison puts it he s been hooked ever since alison was runner up on the cbs summer reality series big brother where her relationship with donny was often discussed although he was not in the house with her alison says that although she and donny have hurt each other in the past she loves him with all her heart and wouldn t ever want to hurt him again she describes him as much calmer than herself and she loves to be the center of attention while he likes to just watch from the sidelines donny is the first person in his family to graduate from college he describes himself and alison as both good looking outgoing and extremely competitive he says his most exciting moment in his life was scoring a touchdown in front of people when and where did you meet alison donny and i were both at a university of pittsburgh athletic convention when he was introduced i thought he was absolutely gorgeous so i remembered his name about two weeks later i sought him out and introduced myself we hit it off immediately but he was a little too persistent so i didn t talk to him for a year the following year i was walking my dog in my new neighborhood at school and donny was sitting on the front stoop of his house which was two doors down from mine we exchanged phone numbers and have basically been together ever since if you could describe your relationship in one phrase or sentence what would it be alison only the strongest survive donny and i didn t have the best relationship ever but now we are better stronger and more in love than ever have you ever traveled together before if so what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together alison we went to canada and to mississippi to see his relatives why did you decide to team up for the amazing race alison donny s the strongest quickest guy i know and i wouldn t want to be away from him again on another reality show we figured reality tv tried to rip us apart the least they could do is throw us together as you begin the race how do you think this experience will affect your relationship alison we decided that we are going in as a couple and we are leaving as a couple we also try to tell ourselves that we need to push each other and take all the mushy lovey dovey stuff out and just compete together what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team alison i m soooo impatient but i m quick and i m usually on top of the game what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team bio before the race\n",

                                                                bob joyce are both widowers who lost their partners to cancer even though both lived in mount laurel new jersey they met on an internet dating site and have been dating for over a year both claim that since they ran in different circles of friends they never would have met one another if not for this website and have been loving life and each other ever since bob has two adult children and joyce has three all of whom are very happy and supportive of their parents relationship both say that they love new challenges share a lot of the same moral political and family values have a very active lifestyle and are in good physical shape when and where did you meet if you could describe your relationship in one phrase or sentence what would it be have you ever traveled together before if so what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together why did you decide to team up for the amazing race as you begin the race how do you think this experience will affect your relationship what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team bio before the race bob joyce and i met if you can call it that on october when i responded to her profile description on an internet dating service we met at a restaurant a few days later and we are still together joyce november we had our first date after meeting each other via an internet dating service we met at a caf in new jersey bob two widows in love committed to each other and having the time of our lives getting a second change at love and life joyce we truly have a wonderful life together we were both widowed for a while and alone and now we have a second chance to have a wonderful life bob we spent a weekend in new york city weeklong vacations with friends at the beach on the north carolina outer banks and at williamsburg virginia and a long weekend in lake tahoe for a wedding every one of these trips was a fabulous time for both of us we are totally compatible travel mates we like to do many of the same active things we love being outdoors are always on the go enjoy great food and good conversation and each trip was a fun adventure the worst aspect and only bad aspect of these trips was that we had to return to separate households when we returned joyce bob had traveled before he is low maintenance never complains we are compatible in all respects bob for the fun and adventure of course but the main reason is to try to let other folks who may be in the same situation we were before we met widowed lonely wanting a better fuller life to let them know that they can make a new life for themselves get out and try to meet someone as wonderful as we did and enjoy life again joyce because we wanted to tell our amazing story we love new challenges we are physically fit and love to travel bob i expect no big surprises joyce is a smart physically fit take charge focused no nonsense but fun loving woman i think it will only strengthen our relationship joyce i know it will be positive i know we will have a ball bob i am smart in an analytical way and i am in great shape for someone my age i don t get upset easily and can stay focused when all hell is breaking loose my weakness is that i am na ve i tend to believe everyone and great shape at years old is not too great also i am too analytical i would spend too much time planning what to do next rather than getting on with it joyce bob is the analyzer he is the planner i put bob s plans into effect i add some spark to bob he is my rock i will eventually do anything and enjoy it and bob loves to plan bob joyce is in great shape for her age and is very smart she is a take charge type who will let me do some planning but who will then get us moving she is extremely supportive and trusts my decisions without reservation she is an extremely nice person whom people will want to help her weakness is a slight tendency to be overly concerned with mistakes already made rather than forgetting them and worrying about the problems at hand joyce bob and i make a dynamite combo we are basically nice people we have nice families i am the sugar and spice and my bob is the meat and potatoes what a winning team\n",

originally from new york but have since relocated to dallas texas where they own and operate a pizza shop they describe themselves as extremely competitive and stubborn with each always wanting to get his own way marshall explains that he has always tormented his younger brother when lance was six or seven years old marshall sold him a sony walkman for the sale included a hand written contract stating that lance was buying the walkman as is with no refund shortly after buying the walkman lance determined that it was broken lance went crying to their father and told him he wanted his money back but marshall pulled out the contract and refused marshall the older brother recently got engaged by surprising his fianc e while she was at a spa appointment he holds a bachelor of science degree from cornell university and says his biggest accomplishment has been starting an internet security consulting company growing it to cities and employees then selling it off in months lance says that one of his pet peeves about himself is when he doesn t give his all to a project he is working on he says though that his greatest accomplishment so far has been opening up the pizza shop with marshall and seeing the growth lance is looking forward to traveling the world to see all the beautiful honeys and any nude beaches when and where did you meet marshall we met when my mother brought lance home from the hospital when he was born if you could describe your relationship in one phrase or sentence what would it be marshall brothers friends and business partners have you ever traveled together before if so what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together marshall lance and i had never traveled together before why did you decide to team up for the amazing race marshall lance and i knew that we would be good partners for the amazing race because we are very different we have different skill sets and when you put those together we knew we would make a very strong team as you begin the race how do you think this experience will affect your relationship marshall since we started caf nostra together almost two years ago we knew that nothing could test our relationship more than the ups and downs we experienced during the first year of owning a restaurant we are extremely confident that the amazing race can do nothing except strengthen our relationship what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team marshall i bring my levelheaded thinking and intelligence i will think through the tasks at hand and try to come up with the best possible way to tackle them what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team bio before the race\n",

               kami karli are identical twins from eugene oregon who describe themselves as extremely competitive both agree that as children they were adorable but ornery and naughty kami is the general manager of a restaurant her primary motivation for being on the show is to win i m very competitive her pet peeve about herself is that she is always correct all the time kami says that one of the most exciting moments of her life was at a prince concert when she was asked to get on stage and dance with him karli is a full time student at the university of oregon she describes her motivations for being on the show as first wanting the money and second wanting the opportunity to travel for free one of her fears is getting stranded in a third world country without clean bathrooms karli adds that she is sweeter and more forgiving than kami when and where did you meet karli obviously kami and i met inside my mother s womb where we kicked the s t out of each other i m sure if you could describe your relationship in one phrase or sentence what would it be karli kami and i have a sweet and sour love hate relationship we ll argue about petty things but rally together and kick your a if you try and intervene have you ever traveled together before if so what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together karli kami and i traveled to mexico and the west indies together it worked because we both enjoy relaxing reading eating well tipping frivolously and boozing it up it s nice to travel with someone who knows how to have a good time why did you decide to team up for the amazing race karli it seems only natural that two people who walk alike talk alike and sometimes act alike compete together in something so extraordinary as the amazing race as you begin the race how do you think this experience will affect your relationship karli we know this race won t and can t change our relationship because it s been this way for years what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team karli my strengths include staying positive most of the time and athletic endurance weaknesses are my small bladder my need for food every three hours and stubbornness what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team bio before the race\n",

nicole met just over a year ago at a bridal extravaganza in houston texas as reigning miss texas she was there to model a new bridal gown while brandon was there as her escort on the runway right after the bridal show ended brandon got her telephone number and they ve been dating ever since both consider themselves very religious and spiritual people and describe their relationship as god centered brandon a texas a m alum is now a model and has lived in various big cities including new york miami and houston while nicole currently lives in los angeles and is pursuing an acting career nicole s proudest accomplishments have been winning miss texas usa and being the second runner up at miss usa when and where did you meet if you could describe your relationship in one phrase or sentence what would it be have you ever traveled together before if so what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together why did you decide to team up for the amazing race as you begin the race how do you think this experience will affect your relationship what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team bio before the race brandon niki and i met january in houston she was the reigning miss texas usa a regional bridal wear company and sponsor of the miss texas usa pageant had niki debut a new bridal gown at the local bridal extravaganza i was hired to model tuxedos and escorted niki down the runway nicole i was miss texas usa and i modeled a bridal gown for the bridal extravaganza brandon was modeling a groom s tuxedo and was paired up with me to be my escort he got my number after the show and we ve been together ever since brandon our relationship is god centered nicole best friends brandon no nicole no brandon niki and i spend a lot of time apart because modeling keeps me on the road we figure the race will be a great opportunity for us to spend a lot of time together nicole there is no one i would rather spend my time with so when i found out about the race i knew brandon had to be my partner we make such a good team brandon i have no idea how the race will be nicole i know that brandon and i will get along great we never really get to see each other so i m just looking forward to getting to see him for an extended period of time brandon i think i can be a good encourager for niki my biggest weakness is stress nicole i think i do a good job of staying focused and not getting discouraged i am not a runner so when it comes to anything that has to do with running i slow us down brandon niki makes good decisions oftentimes she s decisive when i m not she s really competitive but easily discouraged nicole brandon has a lot of strengths he keeps me going when i feel down when i m tired he carries me he works really hard at whatever he does and usually finishes on top brandon is really laid back so being firm and assertive isn t his strongest area he sometimes can be a pushover he is also not so patient with people when he is nervous other than that he is perfect\n",

her jordache jeans when chip introduced himself to kim and asked if he could treat her to a drink of her choice she flatly refused he was undaunted however and kept persisting finally obtaining her phone number at first kim was not interested in chip at all but over time he managed to change her image of him especially when she saw him two months later cruising down crenshaw boulevard in his brand new royal blue z sports car kim is the owner of an information technology recruiting company she says that her proudest accomplishment is marrying chip and having their three children elon phillip iii and kristen she says that she and her teammate are soul mates with the same life goals who want the best for each other chip is the owner of a web technology company aside from marrying kim he said his second biggest accomplishment was finishing college at age he said he most resembles boxer george foreman minus his money and his wife looks like olympic runner florence griffith joyner when and where did you meet chip we officially met at a party in the recreation room of the oakwood garden apartments in marina del rey in i was so spellbound with kim s beauty that though she was not overwhelmed with me i persisted to get her phone number then her heart i saw the diamond in the rough if you could describe your relationship in one phrase or sentence what would it be chip we praise god that we have one of the most healthy and happy marriages that we know of by design kim and i spend approximately hours a day together we work play exercise eat party sleep love laugh argue fuss and strategize together we are soul mates due to our life priorities have you ever traveled together before if so what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together chip we have traveled together throughout many of the united states hawaii included we have also traveled to jamaica cancun the bahamas and virgin islands we love most aspects of traveling together since i am a large individual i am especially uncomfortable sitting in very small coach seats why did you decide to team up for the amazing race chip one of our favorite television shows is the amazing race also kim and i are very competitive we always aim to win at anything in which we participate kim absolutely loves to travel and i love to compete in athletic competitions so it was natural for us to want to participate in the amazing race as you begin the race how do you think this experience will affect your relationship chip kim and i have absolutely no expectations as far as the amazing race affecting our relationship we know that we have a strong relationship going into it what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team chip i am an ex athlete not professional i can do most athletic things well i also have good people skills i am the heart of our team i make certain that others are well managed while we win my weakness is that i may care too deeply for my competitors because they can t win too what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team bio before the race\n",

school spanish class joe moved to los angeles six years ago to expand his advertising business while avi is still in brooklyn and teaching at the same high school where they met they are both proud of their similar jewish upbringings joe describes himself as the stereotypical new york jew their similar characteristics are their knowledge and appreciation of the same yiddish expressions and their love of the mets joe describes himself as jerry seinfeld meets yoda with donald trump s business flair and says avi is george costanza meets napoleon however avi sees himself more as woody allen and sees joe as shaggy from scooby doo they both agree that one of their most memorable times together was meeting avi s childhood idol tom wopat after a broadway play although the distance between new york and los angeles prevents their weekly kibbitz sessions at the local kosher deli they make up for it by spending many hours talking on the phone how would you describe your previous travel experience what is the most stressful aspect of traveling why did you want to be on the amazing race have you and your partner traveled together before if so what was it like what do you fear most about competing in the amazing race what strengths and weaknesses do you bring to the team what strengths and weaknesses does your teammate bring to the team what will you miss the most from home besides your bed what languages do you speak what destination are you hoping to visit what country do you feel best prepared for bio before the race xa avi i have done some travel mainly with my family canada western and southern us and i had my bar mitzvah in israel in recent years i have been to england and france to compete in martial arts tournaments and to alaska so i could experience the wilderness xa joe i ve seen the vast majority of this country every region about states in all including a new york to california drive as far as international i ve only hit europe once but saw the two coolest cities there amsterdam and belgium had a croissant in charles de gaulle airport been to west mexico on a cruise and was in the dominican republic for my honeymoon xa avi making flights on time ever since it s such a hassle especially the security do i look like a terrorist get real xa joe i love traveling and find it relaxing only stressful things are trying to pack everything to do in whatever time we are there crowded airplanes are annoying otherwise i m such a workaholic and have such a hands on business that the most stressful thing about being on vacation is forgetting about work or checking my email xa avi looks like it s going to be a fantastic adventure and we can win it xa joe i can t sing dance or act but i am a character reality tv is perfect for a guy like me besides i get to travel the world with my best friend and have a chance to win a huge prize without kissing trump s tush xa avi no first time for everything i m sure we ll be great xa joe it s weird but in years of friendship avi and i have never even taken a day trip together this will be a long overdue bonding vacation xa avi getting eliminated first xa joe if i feared anything i wouldn t be running the amazing race that said i hope that i don t face a challenge with unkosher food because i m not compromising how i ve lived my live even for a million dollars xa avi my main strengths are my logical mind and physical ability i m an excellent driver and very good with directions my partner is the people person i ll be running them over he ll be picking them up my weakness is that sometimes i m too gung ho with my first idea about something i don t take the time to see all the options xa joe strengths amazing eyesight eye for details memory and sense of direction and awesome skills at negotiation and persuasion weaknesses i m not the most athletic guy in the world but i ve been working with a trainer for almost two years so it s time to see what i m made of xa avi joe s best attribute is his ability to finesse things out of people i m only good with women and waiters he s good with everyone period joe s a holistic thinker and an excellent planner he can see all the stuff i don t additionally he s always been my moral compass seems like i lost mine years ago xa joe avi is the more athletic of the two of us and is a solid runner he has patience and can be very charming to strangers most important he s the devil to my angel if we have to do something sneaky and cutthroat then he s the man for the job avi s only weakness will be if i lose my comb because that little bald man clearly won t be carrying a spare xa avi my daughter i speak to her every day i can t imagine not hearing her voice say daddy for a whole month i love her so much it s going to be torture xa joe i ll miss having kosher food the mets my friends and family no matter how wacky they are my really cool apartment at the beach and yes wifey my new bride sharon i ll miss you too xa avi english a lot of spanish some yiddish which is like german a bit of french and russian too xa joe i can speak enough spanish to be conversational and just enough yiddish to be funny in a catskills kind of way xa avi anything eastern i do both chinese and japanese martial arts so i hoping to visit those countries i d love to sit with the llamas in tibet and i d really like to go to peru and costa rica or brazil to see the rain forest before it disappears xa joe i m hoping to see japan which i think is the most beautiful country out there italy would be cool too xa avi any place they speak spanish it ll be easier for me to understand them also any wild cities like bangkok we re both city boys the concrete jungle is our native element xa joe the only countries i feel prepared for are all the countries i mentioned that i ve been to if we go there hopefully things will look familiar and avi and i will have an advantage\n",
