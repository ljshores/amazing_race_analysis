She is a take-charge type who will let me do some planning, but who will then get us moving. She is extremely supportive and trusts my decisions without reservation. She is an extremely nice person whom people will want to help. Her weakness is a slight tendency to be overly concerned with mistakes already made, rather than forgetting them and worrying about the problems at hand.', 'Joyce: Bob and I make a dynamite combo.

If so, what were the best and worst aspects of traveling together?\nChristie: The best part of traveling together is just that: We get to be together all the time. I think we start to go through withdrawal if we spent too much time apart. The worst is our need to be in control. We each want to do it our own way, and usually feel it\'s the best way to go. When traveling, this way of thinking can lead to a lot of conflict.\nWhy did you decide to team up for THE AMAZING RACE?\nChristie: We are both super competitive, love to travel, and look forward to new and interesting challenges. There is no doubt that for this type of challenge, together our Team has everything it takes to win.\nAs you begin the Race, how do you think this experience will affect your relationship?\nChristie: We are hoping it will bring us closer together and help us learn new things not only about ourselves, but about each other as well.\nWhat strengths and weaknesses do you and your partner bring to the Team?\n']","['\n', 'The Amazing Race 5', 'The Amazing Race 31']"

For an immigrant Cambodian kid, graduating from college and getting this far in my career is a huge accomplishment.\nWhat famous person reminds you of yourself? Short Round from ""Indiana Jones."" I love a good adventure.\nWhat famous person reminds you of your teammate? Lucy Ricardo from ""I Love Lucy."" Isabelle is always up to something.\nWhat scares you most about traveling? Being robbed and stranded.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? Sounds strange, but I like airports and plane rides. And then when I get to my destination, it\'s trying the local food.\nBiggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: The biggest challenge Isabelle and I face is the way we speak to one another. I may think she\'s copping attitude or yelling at me while she may think she\'s just talking normally and vice versa with me. This is where our communication wave breaks. We have been dealing with this since day one of our relationship and it could cause some serious issues on the Race.\nPet peeve about your teammate: My biggest pet peeve with Isabelle is that she won\'t take initiative in helping around the house. I have to constantly ask her to pick up after herself or fold the laundry. And then she\'ll complain that I bug her too much.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? I would love to travel to Tokyo because of how busy the city can be. I would love to experience the Japanese cuisines. I just want to get lost in it all.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? I want to see the world with Isabelle! After this race hopefully we will know if we are ready to take our relationship to the next level.\n', 'Name: Isabelle Du\nAge: 28\nHometown: Tustin, California\nConnection to your teammate: Girlfriend\nCurrent occupation: Model\nDescribe what you do: As a model, I\'ve lived and worked abroad for four years in Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Some of my past work has included FHM, Elle, Cosmopolitan, Tresemme, Wet Seal and Mossimo.\n3 words to describe you: Adaptable, spontaneous and indecisive.\nFavorite hobbies: Karaoking, ebaying and swimming.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? It was a dream come true to model abroad because I never got a chance to study abroad during college. When the opportunity came, I didn\'t think twice about it and jumped right in. I learned so much about myself by being on my own and away from everything I\'ve ever known.\nWhat famous person reminds you of yourself? I\'ve never actually seen the show but Dennis always says that I remind him of Lucy from ""I Love Lucy.""\nWhat famous person reminds you of your teammate? Ross Geller from ""Friends.""\nWhat scares you most about traveling? For the most part, traveling doesn\'t scare me. If I could do one thing for the rest of my life, it would be to travel. However, I can admit that I\'m slightly concerned that I won\'t know what the country\'s laws are and I\'ll get thrown into their jail for doing something that\'s so normal over here in the states. I should really reconsider watching episodes of ""Locked Up Abroad.""\nWhat excites you most about traveling? It\'s a guaranteed adventure. I can\'t stand being at home because everyone has the same mundane updates about their lives. I want to do things that only a rare handful can do. Once you\'re in a new environment, new experiences are to be had, and even the crazy ones make good stories later.\nBiggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: Dennis likes to plan every little thing while I\'m easygoing and carefree and will improvise things on a whim. He\'s not as spontaneous but he\'s open to the idea of it so long as I can convince him.\nPet peeve about your teammate: He constantly reminds me about how I don\'t do anything around the house, but it\'s a work in progress and I\'m really working on it!\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? The Maldives is my #1 dream destination because every single photo I have seen of this place is heaven. I have to get there before it goes under water completely! And also, I can never say no to Vietnam. It\'s where my family is from, it\'s where I lived for four years and I have a very deep connection to it.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? My dream is to live all over the world. Not just traveling it, but LIVING all over it. And as unrealistic as that may sound to a lot of people, I know it\'s possible. I\'ve had a taste of it and I want to live abroad again. I like having as few possessions as possible because I really think that\'s what weighs us down in life. Dennis has agreed that he\'d be willing to go for it but sometimes I\'m not sure if he\'s just saying that to appease me. He can be so calculative that I think it really holds him back from doing the ""carpe diem"" things in life. He doesn\'t even think we have that much stuff together while I think we have TOO much stuff. I want him to do ""The Amazing Race"" with me so he\'ll become more free-spirited and won\'t have to feel so calculated about living all over the world with me.\n']",['no profile info']

Showing myself and the world that competitive eaters are the best at solving problems and have a blast beating people.\n', ""Name: Tim Janus\nAge: 41\nInstagram: @timothyjanus\nTwitter: @eaterx\nHometown: New York, New York\nCurrent occupation: Waiter/Bartender/Manager/Competitive Eater\nDescribe what you do: I am a waiter at a very comfortable, high-end pizza/wine bar. I'm an on-hiatus competitive eater, named Eater X, one of the best in the whole wide world! I'm also the world burping champion, according to the World Burping Federation.\nThree words to describe you: Determined, loyal, and daydreamer.\nFavorite hobbies: Skiing, sleeping, crossword puzzles, and reading the news and trying to understand this world.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I was the third eater ever to eat 50 hot dogs in 10 minutes. Joey was the second. Nobody believed I could do it until I did it, but I worked hard and surprised everybody. I felt like I did what I once thought was impossible, and in general I'm proud of myself anytime I persevere.\nWhat scares you most about traveling? Nothing. It's an adventure. I'm on vacation. Who cares?\nWhat excites you most about traveling? I love learning new things about people and customs. People do things differently all around the world, and it's easy for us to believe that our way is somehow better or makes more sense than somebody else's. But when you travel and you're open to learning, you see that every way is valid and worthwhile and worthy of respect. We do things a certain way because that's what took hold where we are, not because our ways are any better than anybody else's. I really enjoy being reminded of that again and again and again by seeing it firsthand.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? Australia. I love it down there—the land, the animals, the accents. If I get eliminated in Australia, I may never come home.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running the race (other than winning $1 million)? It would be a lot of fun for me to hang out and goof around with Joey. We've always lived on opposite coasts, and we've always competed against each other. We're friends, and we've traveled together for contests, but we've always been rivals. Win or lose, it'd be cool to bond over this adventure and this shared goal.\n""]",['no profile info']

I hope to finish the Race. We came so close last time. I hate not finishing something that I start, and to be given another opportunity to run the Race is a blessing. This time I\'m going to finish and hopefully at the same time, entertain the entire world!\nAny strategic changes you will make heading into this Race: This time around we will be a little more careful of what we say and who we say it to. We want to make sure everyone gets to know us first before we start racing and becoming super competitive. Plus, we do not want to get u-turned twice again. In the beginning of our last season, we were unfortunately portrayed as being sneaky and manipulative, which wasn\'t the case. Certain teams didn\'t understand our humor and how we were running the race.\n', ""Name: Jamal Zadran\nAge: 26\nHometown: Irvine, Calif.\nPrevious Seasons: Season 23\nCurrent occupation: Owner, Z.I.G (Zadran Investment Group)\nDescribe what you do: I run my own private investment group, specializing in real estate and the automobile industry. Zadran Investment Group operates an independent dealership to sell cars to the public, buys and flips homes in the Southern California area, and operates as a reality firm to the public. We also manage equity portfolios with trading of stocks, bonds and forex, and options.\nBiggest mistake you made in your previous season: Showing our competitiveness to other teams, making us the biggest threat of the race.\nMost memorable moment from your first Race: The first-hand experience of racing around the world and interacting with different people and their cultures.\nFavorite place you visited on your first season: Austria and Portugal are at the top of my list of favorite places because of how beautiful the cities looked as we were racing. They're both so rich in history, and definitely places I would want to visit in the future with my wife.\nWhy do you want to run the Race again? I feel like we have some unfinished business to take care of. The way we went out the last race was kind of unfair and out of our hands.\nHow have you changed since the last time you competed? Nothing much has changed! We're still crazy, funny, cool guys who enjoy life!\nWhat are you passionate about? I'm very passionate about winning and trying not to make any mental mistakes.\nPeople would be surprised to learn: That I can speak four different languages and used to be a linguist. So picking up new languages in a new country in a very short time shouldn't be too hard!\nBiggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: The other competitors on the Race. Some are back for the 3rd time and there is no team we will take for granted.\nPet peeve about your teammate: He can be sensitive to criticism and at times can be stubborn.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? I would like to visit some African nation with all wild animals. To have any challenge where we interact with animals is always fun.

We\'ve known each other basically all of our lives and I would see him from time to time because our older sisters were on the same cheerleading squad, but did not start actually communicating until I got to high school. Just about every day of my freshman year, before homeroom, CJ would run by my locker just as I would get it open and slam it closed.

My three children! They are not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well. They are the most incredible people I know and I am so blessed to be their mom!\nWhat scares you most about traveling? Getting lost in a country where I am not welcome. I would not do well in jail and don't look good in orange.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? Everything! Experiencing different cultures, eating different food, seeing as much as possible and meeting locals!\nBiggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: The biggest challenge Hagan and I will experience will probably be patience with each other. I am not the fastest athlete on the planet, and for realizing that she is my partner in this and not just my daughter, trusting each other and not giving up!\nPet peeve about your teammate: Her ability to not disconnect from her phone/social media and just enjoy the time together.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? I would love to visit Brazil, Holland, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea and New Zealand.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)?

Seeing different cultures and just how beautiful the world really is. There is so much to see outside of Texas…who knew?!\nBiggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: Power struggle. Yes, she is my mom, but I have a very hard head and when I think I'm right, no one can change my mind. I like to have control but I realize she is my mom and I need to respect her and her opinions too! Also, being a parent-child team, we don't have advantages that the teams of two younger members have. Plus, we're an all girl team. I am very competitive and I hate losing. But I need to know and remember that she will give her best and I don't want to get frustrated with her, nor do I want to let HER down!\nPet peeve about your teammate: Honestly, as cheesy as it sounds, it's how nice she is, however, I'm so lucky that she is that way. When I'm in a competitive situation, I want to yell and be crazy while she just wants to be supportive and nice. So if we get behind I know she'll be positive and I will be the one crying, screaming and saying things that I'm sure I'll regret…ha! But we complement each other really well.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? Africa. I doubt we go there because the season before us did. But I would love to see all the wildlife. I'm a huge animal lover. If it was legal, and not extremely dangerous, I would keep wild animals in my house.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? All I hope to accomplish is that at the end of the day, I know I did my very best and put everything I had into every leg. I hope to come out of this appreciating my mom, even more than I already do, because I know how hard she will work and how much she believes in us as a team.

Moving and only having your sister as a constant made us super close, then we went to college, got married, and didn't live together anymore. We still love to do everything together. Elissa was on Big Brother after I was, we got engaged the same weekend, we got married the same year, and we had babies together! So for us, doing the Race together is a dream come true! SISTER BONDING!\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? Africa Safari again. It’s amazing, I mean who gets to do that? But excited for everywhere.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running the Race with your partner (other than winning one million bucks)? Bonding time and building memories. Time with my sister is so valuable since we are both so busy with life. This is an opportunity to make some memories as sisters! We didn't get to do BB together so this will be really fun and exciting! We get to make memories, go on a crazy adventure and try to make better lives for our families.\nWho do you think will be your biggest competition: Racers, Houseguests, or Castaways? I think the biggest threats are the Racers. The Race teams know what to expect and even though I have raced twice, my partner has never raced so this will be totally new to her. It's probably good to have a new set of eyes on something I feel so confident about, but I also hope that she listens to me because after all, I've done this twice before and NEVER BEEN ELIMINATED. This also adds pressure on both of us, but I mean I'm Rachel Reilly, I've won two reality shows. I’ve got this in the bag\xa0;)\nDo you think Big Brother prepared you for The Amazing Race? Do you think you learned anything on BB that will help you on the Race? \nI think being on The Amazing Race prepared me more for this than Big Brother. The Amazing Race isn't usually as strategic with the other Racers, but I think since we have Racers, Houseguests, and Castaways we are going to really see more of a social game being played. I am totally prepared to make alliances on this race and use my race experience and my BB experience.\n"", ""Age: 32\nInstagram: @ELISSERCISE\nTwitter: @ELISSAREILLYS\nHometown: Las Vegas\nCurrent occupation: Founder, CEO Drop Method® App\nDescribe what you do: Rachel and I recently launched a comprehensive fitness and nutrition app, Drop Method®.

My children and graduating college Summa Cum Laude, Presidential Scholar. Also, proud of working on my Masters and the Drop Method® App is HUGE. Obviously being on Big Brother and The Amazing Race are once in a lifetime opportunities.\nWhat scares you most about traveling? Diseases and flying. Also safety of food, activities, and travel.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? Seeing the world—especially with my sister, meeting new people and cultures, realizing the infinite possibilities of our world.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? Africa—to see all the animals.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running the Race with your partner (other than winning one million bucks)? I hope to overcome my fear of flying!\nWho do you think will be your biggest competition: Racers, Houseguests, or Castaways? Definitely the Racers.\nDo you think Survivor prepared you for The Amazing Race? Do you think you learned anything on BB that will help you on the Race? I think we learned that the Big Brother casts are groups of pathological liars and never under any circumstances to trust any of them. Actually, literally, so don't trust Big Brother Houseguests ever, ever, except me. You can trust me with your health in particular.\n"", 'Notes: \n\n1: Leg 1 had two Roadblocks and no Detour.

It\'s funny, after playing volleyball for nearly two decades at some of the highest levels, the thing I\'m proudest of accomplishing in my life has little to do with sports. Nearly 10 years ago I lived and played professional volleyball in Italy, and while I was there I was able to learn and eventually become fluent in the Italian language.Looking back, I am truly proud that I got up every morning, walked down to the town\'s only coffee bar to sit and chat with the Italian villagers, practicing speaking the language until I became fluent. To this day, nine years later, I still keep in touch with many of the same people from that very same town, San Giustino, located in the middle of Italy.\nWhat scares you most about traveling? For some reason I am always nervous about not making my connecting flight.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? I know it\'s cliché, but I truly get most excited about diving into a new culture; tasting exotic and strange foods and drinks unique to the area, listening to a new language, casually exploring a place I\'ve never been before at my own pace.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? I\'m torn between Iceland and Ireland. Fortunately, my career has taken me to many different places around the world, but I\'d really like to play a round of golf in Ireland and snap a few photos in Iceland.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Amazing Race with your partner (other than winning one million bucks)? Growing up watching the show I would often catch myself thinking, ""If that were me, what would I do…"" or ""I could definitely win this roadblock or that detour…"" or ""welp, it\'d be over for me if I had to do that!"" etc. When you watch The Amazing Race at home, you can\'t help but wonder how you would actually fare in such a high stakes competition.\nAnd by some stroke of luck I get this amazing opportunity to legitimately test only my abilities, but that of my partner\'s as well, who just so happens to be both my brother and the kid who sat there with me watching The Amazing Race on TV, bouncing our own strategies off one another over the years. I am excited to see if my brother and I can put some of our many differences aside and come together to hopefully make the formidable team we once imagined we could be if we ever found ourselves on The Amazing Race... without killing one another.\n', 'Name: Maddison McKibbin\nAge: 29\nHometown: Honolulu\nCurrent occupation: Professional beach volleyball player\nDescribe what you do: Since 2015, my brother Riley and I have been professional beach volleyball players']",['no profile info']

I can't wait to find out how I react in crazy stressful situations while simultaneously diving into new and beautiful cultures.\nWhat qualities do you hope your partner has?: I hope that my partner is physically strong, smart (preferably a math wiz) and down to earth/humble.\nWhat qualities will be hard for you to put up with in a partner?: With a background as a pediatric psych nurse, I have proven capable of handling pretty much any kind of personality. I would find it most difficult to deal with a partner who displays arrogance and negativity. The Amazing Race is an adventure of a lifetime. If I was partnered with someone who didn't truly appreciate this once in a lifetime experience due to his/her ego, I would be super bummed. Positive vibes only!\nWhat do you think will be the biggest challenge you and your teammate face?: One of the greatest assets to any team is effective communication. Because this season is so unique in that we are all strangers, it may be challenging (but imperative) to quickly learn one another's communication styles and preferences. Without good communication, we are toast!\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why?: I have always wanted to visit Southeast Asia- specifically Thailand.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)?: I hope to experience as many cultures as possible while making lifelong friends along the way.""]",['no profile info']

I like being in control when I\'m traveling and giving up control to a taxi driver terrifies me.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? I\'m incredibly fascinated by all cultures around the world and learning about different ways of life. There are so many things I\'ve never experienced and being able to see new places and cultures with James is something that I\'m so excited for. Not many people get this opportunity and I want us to soak up every moment.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? It has always been a dream of mine to go to Ireland and see or stay in a castle. I don\'t know how I began associating castles with Ireland, but it\'s something I\'ve wanted to do since I was a little kid!\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Amazing Race with your partner (other than winning one million bucks)? Since meeting James in 2014, I\'ve always known that his biggest dream was to run The Amazing Race and to be a part of fulfilling that dream is incredibly humbling. I hope that through this process, I can show James how much I support him in achieving any goal he sets for himself because he has supported me in achieving every goal I have set for myself. He\'s the best partner and I hope that I can be the best partner for him throughout the entire race.\n', 'Name: James Wallington\nAge: 31\nHometown: Grand Rapids, Michigan\nCurrent occupation: Event coordinator and social media manager\nDescribe what you do: I\'ve been coordinating events and weddings in Los Angeles for the past eleven years in addition to working as a social media manager.\nThree words to describe you: Passionate, ambitious, outgoing.\nFavorite hobbies: I love hosting game nights with friends (especially any board game that involves strategy), traveling, party planning, musical theatre, hiking with our dog Zoey, watching competition reality shows, and going to the movies!\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of?
