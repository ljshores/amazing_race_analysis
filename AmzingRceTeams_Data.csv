They were required to return to their taxi, pay their fare, and retrieve their bags before being allowed to check in. During this time, Michael & Kevin arrived, but were issued two 30-minute penalties: one for hiring a taxi to lead them from Bank Bridge to 1 Vladimirsky Prospekt Tower, and another for taking a taxi from the tower to the Church of the Savior on Blood, both of which were explicitly prohibited by two clues. Chad & Stephanie returned during Michael & Kevin\'s penalty time, but were also assessed a 30-minute penalty for taking a taxi to Church of the Savior on Blood when the clue instructed them to travel on foot. Since they were the only two teams left to check in at that point, and Michael & Kevin had more than 30 minutes remaining on their penalty time, Chad & Stephanie were allowed to check in immediately for a 6th place finish, with their penalty time applied to the start of the next leg. Michael & Kevin were then checked in and eliminated.\n\n2: Chad & Stephanie left the Pit Stop in Saint Petersburg 2 hours after their scheduled departure time because they accidentally overslept.

In the end we lost in a bad taxi..so I guess getting in that taxi? Yes.\nMost memorable moment from your first Race: Sleeping on the ground in India, with my dad, between the cowboys and the globetrotters..a moment I never would have expected to be in, but one of the best for sure.

Being robbed and stranded.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? Sounds strange, but I like airports and plane rides. And then when I get to my destination, it\'s trying the local food.\nBiggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: The biggest challenge Isabelle and I face is the way we speak to one another. I may think she\'s copping attitude or yelling at me while she may think she\'s just talking normally and vice versa with me. This is where our communication wave breaks. We have been dealing with this since day one of our relationship and it could cause some serious issues on the Race.\nPet peeve about your teammate: My biggest pet peeve with Isabelle is that she won\'t take initiative in helping around the house. I have to constantly ask her to pick up after herself or fold the laundry. And then she\'ll complain that I bug her too much.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why?

Some of my past work has included FHM, Elle, Cosmopolitan, Tresemme, Wet Seal and Mossimo.\n3 words to describe you: Adaptable, spontaneous and indecisive.\nFavorite hobbies: Karaoking, ebaying and swimming.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? It was a dream come true to model abroad because I never got a chance to study abroad during college. When the opportunity came, I didn\'t think twice about it and jumped right in. I learned so much about myself by being on my own and away from everything I\'ve ever known.\nWhat famous person reminds you of yourself? I\'ve never actually seen the show but Dennis always says that I remind him of Lucy from ""I Love Lucy.""\nWhat famous person reminds you of your teammate? Ross Geller from ""Friends.""\nWhat scares you most about traveling? For the most part, traveling doesn\'t scare me. If I could do one thing for the rest of my life, it would be to travel. However, I can admit that I\'m slightly concerned that I won\'t know what the country\'s laws are and I\'ll get thrown into their jail for doing something that\'s so normal over here in the states. I should really reconsider watching episodes of ""Locked Up Abroad.""\nWhat excites you most about traveling? It\'s a guaranteed adventure. I can\'t stand being at home because everyone has the same mundane updates about their lives. I want to do things that only a rare handful can do. Once you\'re in a new environment, new experiences are to be had, and even the crazy ones make good stories later.\nBiggest challenge you and your teammate will face on The Race together: Dennis likes to plan every little thing while I\'m easygoing and carefree and will improvise things on a whim. He\'s not as spontaneous but he\'s open to the idea of it so long as I can convince him.\nPet peeve about your teammate: He constantly reminds me about how I don\'t do anything around the house, but it\'s a work in progress and I\'m really working on it!\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? The Maldives is my #1 dream destination because every single photo I have seen of this place is heaven. I have to get there before it goes under water completely! And also, I can never say no to Vietnam. It\'s where my family is from, it\'s where I lived for four years and I have a very deep connection to it.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? My dream is to live all over the world. Not just traveling it, but LIVING all over it. And as unrealistic as that may sound to a lot of people, I know it\'s possible. I\'ve had a taste of it and I want to live abroad again. I like having as few possessions as possible because I really think that\'s what weighs us down in life. Dennis has agreed that he\'d be willing to go for it but sometimes I\'m not sure if he\'s just saying that to appease me. He can be so calculative that I think it really holds him back from doing the ""carpe diem"" things in life. He doesn\'t even think we have that much stuff together while I think we have TOO much stuff. I want him to do ""The Amazing Race"" with me so he\'ll become more free-spirited and won\'t have to feel so calculated about living all over the world with me.\n']",['no profile info'],0,0

Also, being a parent-child team, we don't have advantages that the teams of two younger members have. Plus, we're an all girl team. I am very competitive and I hate losing. But I need to know and remember that she will give her best and I don't want to get frustrated with her, nor do I want to let HER down!\nPet peeve about your teammate: Honestly, as cheesy as it sounds, it's how nice she is, however, I'm so lucky that she is that way. When I'm in a competitive situation, I want to yell and be crazy while she just wants to be supportive and nice. So if we get behind I know she'll be positive and I will be the one crying, screaming and saying things that I'm sure I'll regret…ha! But we complement each other really well.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? Africa. I doubt we go there because the season before us did. But I would love to see all the wildlife. I'm a huge animal lover. If it was legal, and not extremely dangerous, I would keep wild animals in my house.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Race (other than winning one million bucks)? All I hope to accomplish is that at the end of the day, I know I did my very best and put everything I had into every leg. I hope to come out of this appreciating my mom, even more than I already do, because I know how hard she will work and how much she believes in us as a team. We will be in a state of constant stress so I hope at the end of this it will only bring us closer.\n""]",['no profile info'],0,0

I now create content (video, photo, and written word) to share the power that outdoor adventure can have in one's life. It's time spent outdoors, pursuing new challenges, that teaches me about this world and helps me be a better person.

The mountains and hills look breathtaking and the architecture is majestic. Most of my travels have taken me to snow-capped mountains, so traveling to a warmer climate would be a nice change of pace!\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running the race (other than winning $1 million)? Besides winning, I hope to reignite my inner competitor, to fight hard for something again, and to work as a team toward a common goal! My competitive ski career ended short because of injury and I left some things on the table—I don't want to let that happen ever again!\n"", 'Notes:\n\n1: On Leg 7, teams switched partners for part of the leg, with Kristi & Jen switching partners with Cody & Jessica.

This is my third Race and my first two I did with Brendon, my husband. It was really fun to race with him but this Race is really exciting because I get to do this with my sister. Growing up, Elissa and I moved a lot. I think I went to three middle schools and two high schools. Moving and only having your sister as a constant made us super close, then we went to college, got married, and didn't live together anymore. We still love to do everything together. Elissa was on Big Brother after I was, we got engaged the same weekend, we got married the same year, and we had babies together! So for us, doing the Race together is a dream come true!

Together we compete as a team of two on the AVP Professional Beach Volleyball Tour (USA\'s domestic circuit) and create video content based around our sport, travel, and our many adventures for our YouTube channel, The McKibbin Brothers.\nThree words to describe you: Coffee, wine, and happy.\nFavorite hobbies: Photography, videography, reading, writing, and drinking coffee.\nWhat is the accomplishment you are most proud of? It\'s funny, after playing volleyball for nearly two decades at some of the highest levels, the thing I\'m proudest of accomplishing in my life has little to do with sports. Nearly 10 years ago I lived and played professional volleyball in Italy, and while I was there I was able to learn and eventually become fluent in the Italian language.Looking back, I am truly proud that I got up every morning, walked down to the town\'s only coffee bar to sit and chat with the Italian villagers, practicing speaking the language until I became fluent. To this day, nine years later, I still keep in touch with many of the same people from that very same town, San Giustino, located in the middle of Italy.\nWhat scares you most about traveling? For some reason I am always nervous about not making my connecting flight.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? I know it\'s cliché, but I truly get most excited about diving into a new culture; tasting exotic and strange foods and drinks unique to the area, listening to a new language, casually exploring a place I\'ve never been before at my own pace.\nWhat country and place would you most like to visit and why? I\'m torn between Iceland and Ireland. Fortunately, my career has taken me to many different places around the world, but I\'d really like to play a round of golf in Ireland and snap a few photos in Iceland.\nWhat do you hope to accomplish by running The Amazing Race with your partner (other than winning one million bucks)? Growing up watching the show I would often catch myself thinking, ""If that were me, what would I do…"" or ""I could definitely win this roadblock or that detour…"" or ""welp, it\'d be over for me if I had to do that!"" etc. When you watch The Amazing Race at home, you can\'t help but wonder how you would actually fare in such a high stakes competition.\nAnd by some stroke of luck I get this amazing opportunity to legitimately test only my abilities, but that of my partner\'s as well, who just so happens to be both my brother and the kid who sat there with me watching The Amazing Race on TV, bouncing our own strategies off one another over the years. I am excited to see if my brother and I can put some of our many differences aside and come together to hopefully make the formidable team we once imagined we could be if we ever found ourselves on The Amazing Race... without killing one another.\n', 'Name: Maddison McKibbin\nAge: 29\nHometown: Honolulu\nCurrent occupation: Professional beach volleyball player\nDescribe what you do: Since 2015, my brother Riley and I have been professional beach volleyball players']",['no profile info'],1,0

I like being in control when I\'m traveling and giving up control to a taxi driver terrifies me.\nWhat excites you most about traveling? I\'m incredibly fascinated by all cultures around the world and learning about different ways of life.
